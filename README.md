# 📊 Automobile Sales Statistics Dashboard

Hi there! 👋

This repository was my final assigment for the **"Data Visualisation with Python"** course offered by IBM on Coursera. Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data, using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. It transforms raw data into a visual format, making it easier to understand trends, patterns, and outliers, especially in large datasets. This repository showcases my final project where I completed a fully interactive dashboard to explore historical automobile sales data using `Python`, `Dash` and `Plotly`.

## 🚗 Project Overview

This dashboard allows users to explore:
- **Yearly automobile sales trends**
- **Recession period impacts on sales**
- **Sales by vehicle type**
- **Monthly breakdowns**
- **Advertisement expenditure**
- **Effect of unemployment rates**

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File/Folder         | Description |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cy-Moh/Data-Visualization-with-Python-offered-by-IBM-on-Coursera.git
   cd data-visualisation-with-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   py -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip -m install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   py Assign_2.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050`
